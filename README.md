<h3>Hi There</h3>

Building streamlined, user-focused web applications is my passion as a junior frontend developer. Using contemporary web technologies, I like to create interactive and responsive interfaces with a strong emphasis on accessibility, usability, and performance. I like to play football and watch the newest games in addition to coding and designing. To keep improving, I keep track of my learning through technical blogs and side projects.
<br>
I constantly broaden my technical toolkit and problem-solving skills through practical projects, code reviews, debugging, and trying out new tools and frameworks. I am constantly looking for ways to improve and overcome obstacles, and I am driven to advance as a developer and work with groups that prioritize excellence, creativity, and user-centered design.
